# Simple Usage

-Build cpp solution: this code is to generate geometry images. You can run this step in your local desktop.

	Modify CMakeLists ï¼š
	add include_directories and link_directories for openmesh and matlab runtime
	Cmake
	
	Build solution:
	Modify config.ini for mesh_dir (directory of OFF models) gi_dir (directory of geometry images) and kpi_dir (directory of key points, you can skip it for dense matching) and other paras.
	
	MCC matlab "mcc -W cpplib:libcompcur -T link:lib compute_curvature.m"
	add libcompcur.dll to folder with GIGen.exe
	run "GIGen.exe config.ini", it will generate geometry images
	
-Python: this code is to train and test network. You should copy the geometry images generated in last step into the server.

	Train network:

		classify_gi_by_pidx_and_split.py -> tfr_gen.py -> train_softmax256.py -> train_mincv_perloss.py
		
-generate descriptor:
	
		descGen.py
